# OWRX-MQTT-for-radiosonde-with-Web-and-APRS-based-uploader-to-server-for-radiosonde-Radiosondy-
OWRX+ MQTT for radiosonde with Web and APRS based server for radiosonde (Radiosondy).



*** To use this program, it is necessary to install an MQTT broker before use. I used Mosquitto, and it was tested on Windows 7 64-bit OS. Of course, MQTT data transmission in OWRX for radiosondes must also be enabled.
