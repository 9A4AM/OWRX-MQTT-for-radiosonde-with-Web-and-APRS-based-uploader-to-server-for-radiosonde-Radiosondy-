# OWRX-MQTT-for-radiosonde-with-Web-and-APRS-based-uploader-to-server-for-radiosonde-Radiosondy-
OWRX+ MQTT for radiosonde with Web (table or radiosonde show on the map with popup information) and APRS based server for radiosonde (Radiosondy).



*** To use this program, it is necessary to install an MQTT broker before use. I used Mosquitto, and it was tested on Windows 7 64-bit OS. Of course, MQTT data transmission in OWRX for radiosondes must also be enabled.


NOTE: This code is mostly taken from an earlier project (RDZ MQTT) that uses most of the same code, so some variable names may be illogical,for example Launchsite which is now Raw ID and others.
